### Reflection: Assignment 8 â€“ State and Activity Modeling
Assignment 8 focus much on the State diagrams and the Activing diagrams relating to functional requirements in assignment 4, user stories and sprints in assignment 6
In this assignment, I worked on showing how parts of the Math Booster App behave and how certain tasks are done step by step. I used state diagrams to show how things like quizzes change from one stage to another, such as starting, submitting, and completing.

I also used activity diagrams to explain the steps a learner follows when taking a quiz, from the beginning to the end. These diagrams helped me understand how the system flows and reacts to user actions.

Overall, this helped me see how the app functions behind the scenes and how different tasks are organized and connected.
